Data was collected by searching for 6 out of the 88 Ohio counties at a time; because the Data Site could only allow statistics of 6 locations at once for export..

We made a checklist of each of the 88 counties and check each County off when we had all of the Census Data regarding it.

Housing Cluster Analysis README
This Python script analyzes housing cluster data to identify demographic variables and visualize the results.

Dependencies
The script uses the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
SciPy
Plotly

Please make sure you have these libraries installed before running the script.

Data
The script reads the following data file:

housingClusterData.csv: This dataset contains housing cluster data with relevant demographic variables.

The script also imports custom functions from the following files:

functionsAll.py
functionsBanned.py
countyName.py
topVariableFunctions.py

Make sure these files are in the same directory as the main script.

Description
This script processes the housing cluster data to analyze demographic variables and visualize the results. The main steps are:

Read and preprocess the housing cluster data.
Split the data into different clusters.
Analyze the banned and non-banned counties in each cluster.
Identify the most common variables among the counties.
Visualize the results using tables and plots.
Preprocessing
The script reads the housingClusterData.csv file and preprocesses it by removing commas from the column names.

Cluster Analysis
The script uses custom functions to split the dataset into different clusters and analyze the coordinates of each cluster.

Banned Counties Analysis
The script filters out banned counties and creates dictionaries for each cluster with their corresponding banned and non-banned counties.



Demographic Variables Analysis

The script identifies the most common demographic variables among the counties and combines them to create a ranking table.

Visualization

The script visualizes the results using Plotly to create tables and plots for the following:

Demographic variables and the counties that are in them the most
Counties' frequency in each demographic variable

Usage

To run the script, simply execute it in your Python environment. Make sure you have the required libraries installed and the necessary data files in the same directory. The script will output the results as tables and plots.

Ohio Counties Demographic Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes various demographic variables of counties in Ohio. The data is processed and visualized using libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and others.

Code Overview
Melting the original dataset: The original dataset is transformed into a long format by melting it. This makes it suitable for plotting and further analysis.

Creating a tidy data frame: The melted data frame is merged with another dataframe to create a tidy data frame, which is easier to work with for further analysis and visualization.

Creating bar chart traces and displaying the plot: The tidy data frame is used to create bar chart traces using Plotly. The bar chart displays the demographic variable values for each county.

Calculating the frequency of variables for each county: A function is defined to calculate the frequency of demographic variables for each county. The resulting data is then converted into a dictionary and sorted.

Visualizing the ranking table using a Plotly table: The ranking table is created based on the calculated frequencies, and the table is visualized using Plotly.

Tidying the data for plotting: The ranking table is further tidied by exploding the list of variables, dropping duplicate columns, and renaming columns for clarity.

Creating another bar chart trace and displaying the plot: A new bar chart trace is created using the tidied data frame, and the plot is displayed. This bar chart shows the demographic variables for each county.

Finding the most frequent demographic variables and counties: The most common demographic variables and counties are identified using the sorted frequency dictionary.

Plotting the counties at risk on a map of Ohio: The county boundaries are loaded from a GeoJSON file, and the demographic data is filtered to include only Ohio counties. The data is then merged, and the county boundaries are plotted on a map of Ohio using Plotly.


County Demographic Analysis (Education & Labor)

This script analyzes a dataset of counties in the United States with various demographic variables to identify clusters of similar counties and find patterns in demographic variables that are common among these counties.

Libraries
The script uses the following libraries:

NumPy
pandas
matplotlib

scipy
plotly
Data
The dataset contains demographic information for each county, including:

Education
Disability status
Health insurance coverage
Labor force participation

Banned or not



Analysis
The script performs the following steps:

Import necessary libraries and read in the dataset as a pandas DataFrame.

Split the dataset into clusters based on similarities in demographic variables.

Calculate convex hulls for each cluster to identify the boundaries that enclose all the data points within the cluster.

Filter out banned counties and create separate dictionaries for each cluster.

Find counties inside the convex hull of banned counties for further analysis.

Identify the most common demographic variables among the counties at risk.

Create a table of demographic variables and the counties they are most commonly associated with.

Plot the frequency of counties in each variable, and display the results in a table.

Output
The script generates visualizations in the form of tables and bar charts, showing:

The most common demographic variables among the analyzed counties.
The number of counties associated with each demographic variable.
The list of counties in each cluster.
Bar charts displaying the frequency of counties in each demographic variable

Plotting and Visualization

The script performs the following steps:

Plot the frequency of counties in each demographic variable, sorted by rank.
Create a table displaying the rank, county name, number of demographic variables, and list of demographics for each county.
Create a bar chart showing the attribute value of each demographic variable for each county.
Identify the most frequent demographic variables and the most frequent counties associated with these variables.
Plot the counties at risk on a map of Ohio, with counties color-coded by their risk level (at risk, already banned, or safe).


Output
The script generates visualizations in the form of tables, bar charts, and maps, showing:

The frequency of counties in each demographic variable.
The rank, county name, number of demographic variables, and list of demographics for each county.
A bar chart showing the attribute value of each demographic variable for each county.
The most frequent demographic variables and the most frequent counties are associated with these variables.
