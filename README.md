Ethical Considerations

All data and results should be securely stored and not shared outside of the
project participants.

All TNC data must be deleted from personal devices upon the completion of the
project at the end of the semester.

All data used for this project and outcomes produced will be genuine and raw,
with no tampering to show favorable outcomes.

No personal bias or political bias associated with the 10 counties should impact
the work.

Work produced by the team should be tangible and reusable.

We promise to abide by the standard set by the TNC Code of Conduct.

All analysis will be stated as such and no claim without evaluation will be
made.
